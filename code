"""Problem 1: Write an infinite loop that prints “Infinite”.
An infinite loop never ends. The condition is always true. 

"""

  """Problem 2: Using a while loop, create a list called L that contains the numbers 0 to 10.
On each iteration, the loop should append the current value of a counter variable to the
list and then increase the counter by 1. The while loop should stop once the counter
variable is greater than 10.

"""

numbers is greater than 100.
